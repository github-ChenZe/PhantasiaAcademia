\section{Galois Theory} % (fold)
\label{sec:galois_theory}

It's a good Day to learn Galois Theory, a Theory created by a French Physicist Galois, which provides the Foundation for the current Understanding of the Gauge Theory. Let me first clarify a few Concepts:
\begin{cenum}
    \item Galois Field: a Field generally denoted by $F$. Physicists like to add Indices to it and write it as $F^{\mu\nu}$.
    \item Galois Group: the Group $U\pare{1}$.
    \item Galois Action: an Action which is invariant under Transformations by the Galois Group, $\displaystyle \+cL = \conj{\psi} \pare{i\hbar c\gamma^\mu D_\mu - mc^2}\psi - \rec{4\mu_0}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$.
\end{cenum}
